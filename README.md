# tocgen

An opinionated Table of Contents generator for Github. This allows only one level headings - specified via comments, and supports only heading level 5 for all items. Why? Too much bold text and headings spoils readability for certain type of content.

## Install

`npm install -g tocgen`

## Usage

`tocgen README.md`
